crypto keys

Symmetric key, Asymmetric key


Symmetric = same key is used to decrypt and is saved in cookie (shared key)
Asymmetric key= 2 keys 1 for encrypyt and other for decrypt
 eg. 

 pawan        harsh 
 k1|k2         k3|k4
 
 k1|[k4]         k3|[k2]

so k1 and k3 are private and k2 and k4 are public
depend on which key is shared
